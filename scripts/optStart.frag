/*
 * This is an "optimized" JS file from the gaia-email-libs-and-more project that
 * is checked-in as a vendor artifact.  The repo is at:
 * https://github.com/mozilla-b2g/gaia-email-libs-and-more
 *
 * It is created by the gaia-email-opt.js Makefile target.
 *
 * Right now the file is concatenated (with comments left intact) as opposed to
 * minified so that 1) if you need do debug things, you're not looking at
 * gobblety-gook, 2) the diffs will make sense, and 3) repo size shouldn't bloat
 * as badly as if it was minified since line diffs should be fairly stable and
 * minimal.
