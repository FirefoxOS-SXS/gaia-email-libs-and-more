 * - TODO: perform normalization of quote markup from different clients into
 *   blockquotes, like how Thunderbird conversations does it.
 * - snippet generation: Try and generate a usable snippet string from something
 *   that is not a quote.  In cases of complicated HTML, probably just fail.
 *
 * We may eventually try and perform more detailed analysis like `quotechew.js`
 * does with structured markup, potentially by calling out to quotechew, but

/**
 * Whitelisted HTML tags list. Currently from nsTreeSanitizer.cpp which credits
 * Mark Pilgrim and Sam Ruby for its own initial whitelist.
 *
 * Some things are just not in the list at all:
 * - SVG: Thunderbird nukes these itself because it forces
 *   SanitizerCidEmbedsOnly which causes flattening of everything in the SVG
 *   namespace.
 *
 * Tags that we are opting not to include will be commented with a reason tag:
 * - annoying: This thing is ruled out currently because it only allows annoying
 *   things to happen *given our current capabilities*.
 * - scripty: This thing requires scripting to make anything happen, and we do
 *   not allow scripting.
 * - forms: Thunderbird explicitly and unconditionally forbids forms, presumably
 *   because they are useless locally without scripting, and their target is
 *   is not reflected in the UI like hyperlinks are or at least should be.
 * - implicitly-nuked: killed as part of the parse process because we assign
 *   to innerHTML rather than creating a document with the string in it.
 * - inline-style-only: Styles have to be included in the document itself,
 *   and for now, on the elements themselves.  We'll support <style> tags at
 *   some point.
 * - dangerous: The semantics of the tag are intentionally at odds with our
 *   goals and/or are extensible.  (ex: link tag.)
 * - interactive-ui: A cross between scripty and forms, things like (HTML5)
 *   menu and command imply some type of mutation that requires scripting.
 *   They also are frequently very attribute-heavy.
 * - non-css-presentation: It's a styling thing that's not CSS.  Apparently
 *   Thunderbird's original sanitizer didn't let this kind of stuff through.
 *   Now that nsTreeSanitizer is used, SanitizerDropNonCSSPresentation is
 *   specified by default.
